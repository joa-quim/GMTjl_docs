# lines

```julia
lines(cmd0::String="", arg1=[]; kwargs...)
```

Reads (x,y) pairs and plot lines with different levels of decoration. The input can either be a file
name of a file with at least two columns (x,y), but optionally more, a GMTdatset object with also two
or more columns.

This module plots a large variety of lines and polygons. It goes from *simple* lines and polygons
(color/pattern filled or not) to the so called *decorated* lines. That is, lines decorated with
symbols and text patterns.

This module is a subset of `plot` to make it simpler to draw line plots. So not all (fine)
controlling parameters are not listed here. For the finest control, user should consult the {{< gmtref plot >}} module.
