    polygonize(geom; gdataset=false)

### Parameters
* `geom`: the geometry. This can either be a GDAL AbstractGeometry or a {{< gmtref GMTdataset type=gmttype >}} (or vector of it), or a Matrix
* `gdataset`: Returns a GDAL IGeometry even when input are {{< gmtref GMTdataset type=gmttype >}} or Matrix

Polygonizes a set of sparse edges.

A new geometry object is created and returned containing a collection of
reassembled Polygons: NULL will be returned if the input collection doesn't
correspond to a MultiLinestring, or when reassembling Edges into Polygons is
impossible due to topological inconsistencies.

### Returns
A GMT dataset when input is a Matrix or a GMT type (except if `gdaset=true`), or a GDAL IGeometry otherwise
