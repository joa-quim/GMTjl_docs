    intersects(geom1, geom2)

### Parameters
* `geom1`: the geometry. This can either be a GDAL AbstractGeometry or a {{< gmtref GMTdataset type=gmttype >}} (or vector of it), or a Matrix
* `geom2`: Second geometry. AbstractGeometry if `geom1::AbstractGeometry` or a GMTdataset/Matrix if `geom1` is GMT type 

Returns whether the geometries intersect

Determines whether two geometries intersect. If GEOS is enabled, then this is done in rigorous fashion
otherwise `true` is returned if the envelopes (bounding boxes) of the two geometries overlap.
