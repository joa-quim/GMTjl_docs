```
trisurf(in, kw...)
```

Plots the 3-D triangular surface.

The triangulation is defined by the points in a Mx3 matrix or a GMTdataset with data  x, y, z in the 3 first columns.
The triangles are computed with a Delaunay triangulation done internaly. Since this is a `plot3d` *avatar*
all options in this function are those of the `plot3d` program.

### Example

Create a set of 3-D points and plot the surface defined by the triangulation.

```{julia}
using GMT

x,y,z = peaks(N=45, grid=false);
trisurf([x[:] y[:] z[:]], pen=0.5, show=true)
```


```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
using GMT
GMT.doc_source_links("trisurf")
```
