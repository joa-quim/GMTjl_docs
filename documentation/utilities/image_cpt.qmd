# image_cpt!

```julia
image_cpt!(img::GMTimage, cpt::GMTcpt, clear=false)

or

image_cpt!(img::GMTimage, cpt::String, clear=false)
```

Add (or replace) a colormap to a {{< gmtref GMTimage type=gmttype >}} object from the colors in the cpt.
This should have effect only if `img` is indexed.
Use `image_cpt!(img, clear=true)` to remove a previously existant `colormap` field in `img`
