title: "lasread"
---


```
out = lazread(FileName::AbstractString; out::String="xyz", do_grid=false, do_image=false,
              type::DataType=Float64, class=0, startstop="1:end")
```

Read data from a LIDAR laz (laszip compressed) or las format file.

  * `FileName`: Name of the input LIDAR file.

### Keyword Arguments

  * `out`: Select what data to output. The default is "xyz" meaning that only these three are sent out.  Examples include: "xyz", "xy", "yx", "z", "xyzi", "xyzt", "xyzit", "xyzti", "xyzic" "xyzc",  "RGB", "RGBI", "xyRGB", "xyRGBI".  where 'i' stands for intensity (UInt16), 'c' for classification (Int8) and 't' for GPS time (Float64)
  * `grid`: If true, the output is a GMTgrid. This implicitly sets `out="xyz"` and `type=Float32`.  The grid is built using the `nearneighbor` algorithm. It is recommended to use the `-R` and `-I` options,  but if not provided, the grid is built using the extent of the data and a crude estimate of the increment.
  * `image`: If true, the output is a GMTimage. This implicitly sets `out="xyRGB"` and of course it will  error if the laz file does not contain RGB data. If another color combination is desired, specify it  explicitly, e.g., `out="xyIRG"`. Like the `do_grid` option, it is recommended to use the `-R` and `-I` options,  to control the image extent and resolution.
  * `type`: The float components (xyz) may be required in Float32. The default is Float64.
  * `startstop="start:stop"`: A string that restricts the output to the points from start to stop.
  * `class`: Restrict the output to the points belonging to the classification 'class' (an Integer).  This option implies two passes, with the first for counting the number of points in class.

### Returns

```
OUT is a Type with the folowing fields: `stored`, `grd`, `img`, `ds`, `dsv`, where `stored` is a string
```

indicating what data is stored in output. `grd` is a GMTgrid if `grid` is true or we read a *grided* laz file. `img` is a GMTimage if `image` was set to true and the laz file contains RGB data. `ds` is a {{< gmtref GMTdataset type=gmttype >}} with the xyz data, and `dsv`is a vector of GMTdataset if input opion `out` was set to something else than "xyz" or "xy". The reason for assembling the output in a Type is make the output of `lazread` be type stable. Use $getproperty(out, Symbol(out.stored))$ toget the normal GMT types directly, or, do the reading via $gmtread$ that will do this for you.

### Example

To read the x,y,z,t data from file "lixo.laz" do:

```julia
	D = gmtread(TESTSDIR * "/assets/test.laz")
```


## Methods

```julia
# 3 methods for generic function "lazread" from GMT.Laszip:
 [1] lazread(s::GMT.Laszip.lasout_types)
 [2] lazread(fname::String, out::String, type::DataType, class::Int64, startstop::String, do_grid::Bool, do_img::Bool, opt_RI::String)
 [3] lazread(fname::AbstractString; out, type, class, startstop, kw...)
```
