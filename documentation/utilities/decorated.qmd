# decorated

```julia
decorated(;kwargs...)
```

Create decorated lines with symbols or text labels. See [Line decorations](../common_features/decorated.html) for complete documentation on decoration options.

There are two types of decorated lines:

1. **Lines decorated with symbols** - Front lines with triangles, boxes, circles, etc.
2. **Lines decorated with text** - Quoted lines with text labels

Both types are specified using the `decorated=(...)` keyword with a named tuple.

## Quick Examples

Front line with triangles:
```julia
decorated=(dist="2c", symbol=:triangle, size="0.5c")
```

Decorated line with symbols:
```julia
decorated=(dist="5c", symbol=:circle, size="0.3c", dec2=true)
```

For complete documentation including all placement methods and formatting options, see [Line decorations](../common_features/decorated.html).
