title: "laswrite"
---


```
lazwrite(FileName::AbstractString, xyz; grd_hdr=[], scaleX=nothing, scaleY=nothing, scaleZ=nothing, offX=nothing, offY=nothing, offZ=nothing)
```

or

```
lazwrite(FileName::AbstractString, G::GMTgrid; scaleX=nothing, scaleY=nothing, scaleZ=nothing, offX=nothing, offY=nothing, offZ=nothing)
```

Write XYZ data to a LIDAR laz (laszip compressed) or las format file. The second form is used to write a GMTgrid to a laz file. This is a rather more compressed format that waht is achieved with netCDF, but slightly lossy. Use `lazread` to read the laz file back into a GMTgrid.

```
Where:
	"FileName" Name of the output LIDAR file
	`xyz`:  A Mx3 array with the point coordinates
	`G`:  A GMTgrid object.
```

### Example

To write the x,y,z data to file "lixo.laz" do:

```julia
	lazwrite("lixo.laz", xyz)
```


## Methods

```julia
# 2 methods for generic function "lazwrite" from GMT.Laszip:
 [1] lazwrite(fname::AbstractString, G::GMTgrid{Float32, 2}; scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ, offX, offY, offZ)
 [2] lazwrite(fname::AbstractString, xyz; grd_hdr, scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ, offX, offY, offZ, layout)
```
